# Spend Personal Accounting - Web Version
The goal of this project is to re-create my JavaFX-based personal accounting system using Firebase Firestore, Functions, and Hosting.
By uploading transaction data into Firebase, users will be able to organize transactions into categories and set categorization rules
that allow for auto-classification when new statements are processed. Users will then be able to visualize their spending in 
intuative ways.

The front-end uses jQuery and interfaces with firebase using the firebase SDK.
